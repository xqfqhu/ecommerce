# ecommerce
1. I started with https://github.com/veryacademy/django-ecommerce-project and django source code & doc, getting myself familiar with django's design, useful debug/optimization tools, and what a vanilla ecommerce website should be like. I implemented all features mentioned in veryacademy's project, including display, basket, payment, account management, wishlist although my implementations are not exactly the same as his.
2. Then I added more features and optimized its performance based on stats shown by django-debug-toolbar. Features include: multi-level model, search, filter, recommendation,... I specifically optimized queries, cache (more accurately, I adopt caching to optimize performance)...
